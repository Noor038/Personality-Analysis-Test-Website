                    <p> You want to find inner peace and absolute truth, and you always make an effort to<br>
                        think of others and their needs.<br><br>
        
                        Preferring blue shows that you’re deliberate and introspective. You have conservative<br>
                         convictions, retreat to gentler surroundings in times of stress, and are sensitive to<br>
                         the feelings of others. You’re a loyal friends and lead a sober life.
